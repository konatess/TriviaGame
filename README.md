# TriviaGame
Timing Homework for UW Coding Bootcamp:<br>
This trivia game counts down the seconds for each question.<br>
The theme for this homework is muscles of the human body, specifically the skeletal muscles. I hope that this can be a useful study tool for the students of Discoverypoint School of Massage.
